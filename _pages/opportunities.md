  Our group is diverse and has broad research interests. We do basic to applied research, which means we foucs on the fundamentals, physics and mechanisms which can be applied to real-world applications. In our group, we respect each member's research interests and pride ourselves on being highly supportive of each other.

<p>
  We are always looking for talented, outstanding and self-motivated master and doctoral students, postdoctoral research fellows and senior researchers to join us. The potenial candidates should have solid background either on <strong>solid mechanics, geomechanics, computational modeling, and artificial intelligence</strong>. Although I am not a experimentalist, canditates with material characterizations (pre-testing, in-situ, and post-mortem) skills are also encouraged to join us. Experiments help us discover mechanims, calibrate and validate modeling results.

  Academia is not the only goal in our group, we are also very welcome students who want to pursue a career in industry. If you are interested in joining us, please feel free to reach out together with your CV and brief research statement.
