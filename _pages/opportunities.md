    Our group is diverse and has broad research interests. We do basic to applied research, which means we focus on the fundamentals, physics and mechanisms which can be applied to real-world applications. In our group, we respect each member's research interests and pride ourselves on being highly supportive of each other.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are always looking for talented, outstanding and <strong>self-motivated</strong> master and doctoral students, postdoctoral research fellows and senior researchers to join us. The potential candidates should have solid background either on <strong>solid mechanics, geomechanics, computational modeling, or artificial intelligence</strong>. Although I am not an experimentalist, candidates with material characterizations (pre-testing, in-situ, and post-mortem) skills are also encouraged to join us. Experiments help us discover mechanisms, calibrate and validate modeling results.

    Academia is not the only goal in our group; we are also very welcoming to students who want to pursue a career in industry. If you are interested in joining us, please feel free to reach out together with your CV and brief research statement.
